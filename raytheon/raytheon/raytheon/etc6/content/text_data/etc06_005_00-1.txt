&tMessage=For this portion of the exercise in this workstation you will:<br>1. Measure the voltage across teh relay coil while operating the circuit, using the MIN-MAX feature of the DMM.<br>2. Observe the minimum and maximum voltages.<br>3. Compare the readigns to the measurements obtained in the previous circuit (16v MAX; -OL MIN).<br>4. Determine the effects on a circuit when a relay controls loads and a clamping diode is installed parallel to the relay coil.<br><br>Please click continue to proceed.
