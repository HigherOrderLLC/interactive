<![CDATA[Welcome.  I'm your virtual coach.  This exercise is a pre-requisite for attending: Electrical/Electronics, Terminals and Connectors #18043.04H.  After completing this simulation you will be able to: <BR><BR>1. Perform voltage measurements using the MIN-MAX feature on<br>the DMM.<BR> 2. Demonstrate understanding of the use of a clamping diode <br>in a circuit.<br>It is estimated that it will take 10-15 minutes to complete this session.  Please click Continue. <BR><BR><b>Warning: If you exit this simulation before completion, you MUST restart it when you return.  It is strongly suggested that you take this and each simulation in its entirety.</b>]]>
