&tMessage=In the next portion of the excercise, a diode is placed in the circuit parallel to the relay coil while the relay is active. The diode is reverse-biased when supply voltage is applied. A light-emitting diode (LED) is used to show the effects the diode has on the circuit. Pay attention to it during your circuit tests.<br><br>In an LED, a small lens is built into the diode so the light can be seen. When the LED is forward-biased, it illuminates. When the LED is reverse-biased, it prevents current flow. The LED operates at about 1.5v, so a dropping resistor is needed to prevent damage to the LED.<br><br>Select <b>Continue</b> when you're ready to move forward.
