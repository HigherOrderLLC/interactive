&tMessage=For this portion of the exercise in this workstation you will:<br>1. Measure the voltage across the relay coil while operating the circut,       using the MIN-MAX feature of the DMM.<br>2. Observe the minimum and maximum voltages.<br>3. Compare the readings to the measurements obtained in the<br>    previous circut (16v MAX; -OL MIN).<br>4. Determine the effects on a circut when a relay controls loads and a<br>    clamping diode is installed parallel to the relay's coil.<br><br>Please click Continue to proceed.
